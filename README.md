# Zipfy2

This project is about learning NodeJS and RESTful APIs.

The front end will be in NodeJS. Eventually I plan to add a Django API that will keep track of the Zipfy-ian distrobution/pareto principle of all words entered into the Zipfy web interface. 

The entire Node front end is based off a project I did for a class so it will likely have stuff that isn't relevant to this project, but is useful example code for me.
