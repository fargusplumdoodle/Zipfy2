the lord angel sent to lead israel

 behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared

beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not  for he will not pardon your transgressions  for my name is in him

 but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak  then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries

 for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the hittites and the perizzites and the canaanites the hivites and the jebusites  and i will cut them off

thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works  but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images

and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water  and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee
there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land  the number of thy days i will fulfil

i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come  and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee

and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the canaanite and the hittite from before thee

i will not drive them out from before thee in one year  lest the land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against thee
by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land

and i will set thy bounds from the red sea even unto the sea of the philistines and from the desert unto the river  for i will deliver the
18 0	exodus 24

inhabitants of the land into your hand  and thou shalt drive them out before thee

thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods

whosoever compoundeth any like it or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger shall even be cut off from his people

 and the lord said unto moses take unto thee sweet spices stacte and onycha and galbanum  these sweet spices with pure frankincense  of each shall there be a like weight 
and thou shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the apothecary tempered together pure and holy 

and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where i will meet with thee  it shall be unto you most holy

the call of bezaleel and aholiab

and the lord spake unto moses saying

see i have called by name bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah 

and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship

to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brass

and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanship

and i behold i have given with him aholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan  and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee 

the tabernacle of the congregation and the ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tabernacle

and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense

and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the laver and his foot

and the clothes of service and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest office
20 1	exodus 32

and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place  according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do

the sabbath as a sign

 and the lord spake unto moses saying

speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep  for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations  that ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you

ye shall keep the sabbath therefore  for it is holy unto you every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death  for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people

six days may work be done  but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the lord  whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death

wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant
it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever  for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed

the golden calf

 and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god

32

and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us  for
202	exodus 32

as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him

and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me

and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron

and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf  and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt

and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it  and aaron made proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the lord

and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings  and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play

 and the lord said unto moses go get thee down  for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves 

they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them  they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people 

now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them  and i will make of thee a great nation

 and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand ?

wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth ? turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people
203	exodus 32

remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people

 and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand  the tables were written on both their sides  on the one side and on the other were they written

and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables

and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp
and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome  but the noise of them that sing do i hear

and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing  and moses’ anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount
and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it

 and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them ?

and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot  thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief

for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us  for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him

and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me  then i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf

 and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies
204	exodus 33

then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord side ? let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him

and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbor

and the children of levi did according to the word of moses  and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother  that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day

 and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin  and now i will go up unto the lord  peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin

and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold

yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin —  and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written

and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book

therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee  behold mine angel shall go before thee  nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them

 and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf which aaron made

33

the lord presence promised

and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt
20 5	exodus 33

unto the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it 

and i will send an angel before thee  and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite 

unto a land flowing with milk and honey  for i will not go up in the

midst of thee  for thou art a stiffnecked people  lest i consume thee in the way

 and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned  and no man did put on him his ornaments

for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people  i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee  therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee

and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb

 and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp

and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle

and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses

and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door  and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent door

and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp  but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle
20 6	exodus 33

 and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people  and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight

now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight  and consider that this nation is thy people

and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest

and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence

for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight ? is it not in that thou goest with us ? so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth

 and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken  for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name

and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory

and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee  and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show mercy

and he said thou canst not see my face  for there shall no man see me and live

and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock 

and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by 

and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts  but my face shall not be seen
207	exodus 34

the second tables of stone

and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first  and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest

and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount

and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount  neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount

and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first  and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone

and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord

and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth

keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children children unto the third and to the fourth generation

and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped

and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let my lord i pray thee go among us  for it is a stiffnecked people  and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance

 and he said behold i make a covenant  before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation  and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord  for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee
20 8	exodus 34

israel warned of the idolatry of canaan

 observe thou that which i command thee this day  behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite

take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee 

but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves 

for thou shalt worship no other god  for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god

lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice 

and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods

 thou shalt make thee no molten gods

but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb  and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty

 six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest  in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest

and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the year end
20 9	exodus 34

for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders  neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year
 thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven  neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning

the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother milk

moses and the tables of the law

 and the lord said unto moses write thou these words  for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel

and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights  he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments [heb words]
 and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses’ hand when he came down from the mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him

and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone  and they were afraid to come nigh him
and moses called unto them  and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him  and moses talked with them
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh  and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai

and till moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face

and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses’ face shone  and moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him
